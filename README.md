## Project Overview

In this project, we use environmental audio data to perform two primary tasks:

- **Firework Detection:** Applying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to identify instances of firework sounds in audio recordings. This involves preprocessing the audio data, extracting relevant features, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

- **Sound Propagation Analysis:** Analyzing the propagation patterns of firework sounds by calculating sound intensity and time delay. This allows us to examine how the firework sounds travel and change over distance and time.
